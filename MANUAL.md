## Setup

Iriki is made up of three important components: the engine, the app and vendor provided libraries.

### Engine

The engine comes with the framework.

### App

A sample app (kronos) comes with the default Iriki installation. It should serve as an example.

### Vendors

Vendor provided third-party code need to be installed using composer.

1. Composer

composer install
